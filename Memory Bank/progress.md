## Current Status
The game is fully functional and playable in its current state. All core mechanics are implemented and working correctly. The project has been successfully migrated from a monolithic HTML implementation to a modular React architecture.

The Memory Bank documentation system has been implemented to maintain project knowledge and facilitate future development.

## Known Issues
- No known critical issues at this time
- Mobile touch interactions could be optimized further
- Animation timing may need fine-tuning on slower devices

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Changes
- **Initial Approach**: Single file implementation
- **Current Approach**: Modular components and custom hooks
- **Rationale**: Improved maintainability and separation of concerns

### Animation System
- **Initial Approach**: Basic CSS transitions
- **Current Approach**: Coordinated CSS transforms with state management
- **Rationale**: Better performance and visual fidelity

### State Management
- **Initial Approach**: Direct DOM manipulation
- **Current Approach**: React state with immutable updates
- **Rationale**: More predictable behavior and easier debugging

### Game Logic
- **Initial Approach**: Imperative game logic
- **Current Approach**: Declarative state updates with pure functions
- **Rationale**: Improved testability and reduced side effects

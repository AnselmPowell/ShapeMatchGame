# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The Shape Match Game is currently in a completed state with all core functionality implemented. The focus is now on:

1. **Documentation and Knowledge Transfer**: Creating comprehensive documentation for the project
2. **Code Organization**: Ensuring maintainable and well-structured code
3. **Memory Bank Implementation**: Establishing a Memory Bank system for project continuity

## Recent Changes

- Implemented Memory Bank structure for project documentation
- Completed the React migration from original HTML implementation
- Organized code into modular components and custom hooks
- Added comprehensive documentation
- Implemented move limit system for each level
- Added visual feedback for remaining moves
- Created failure modal for when players run out of moves
- Added drag/swipe movement system for better mobile experience
- Fixed and optimized drag functionality with direction-based visual feedback
- Added undo functionality (one-time use per game restart)

## Next Steps

1. **Potential Enhancements**:
   - Sound effects for game actions
   - Level progression system
   - Score tracking with high scores
   - Additional visual effects
   - Mobile touch optimization

2. **Code Quality**:
   - Add unit tests for utility functions
   - Add integration tests for game mechanics
   - Performance profiling and optimization

3. **User Experience**:
   - Gather user feedback
   - Refine animations and visual effects
   - Add tutorial for new players

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Animation System**:
   - Currently using CSS transforms for hardware acceleration
   - Considering Web Animations API for more complex sequences
   - Balancing visual effects with performance

2. **State Management**:
   - Using custom hooks pattern over global state management
   - Evaluating if Redux or Context API would benefit for future expansion
   - Maintaining immutable update patterns

3. **Board Generation**:
   - Current implementation uses predefined boards
   - Considering procedural generation for infinite play
   - Need to ensure generated boards are always solvable

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **Code Organization**:
   - Components in dedicated folders (game/, ui/)
   - Custom hooks for business logic
   - Pure utility functions for game mechanics
   - Constants for configuration

2. **Styling Approach**:
   - Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
   - Custom animations defined in CSS
   - Consistent color scheme with gradients
   - Responsive design considerations

3. **Animation Coordination**:
   - Sequential animation scheduling
   - State-based animation triggers
   - Timeouts coordinated with CSS transition durations
   - Animation locks to prevent interference

4. **Physics and Mechanics**:
   - Detailed in dedicated gameMechanicsAndPhysics.md file
   - Gravity simulation with iterative algorithm
   - Horizontal-only movement constraints
   - Cascade and chain reaction system
   - Sophisticated timing system for realistic feel

## Learnings and Project Insights

1. **React Patterns**:
   - Custom hooks provide excellent separation of concerns
   - Animation coordination is complex but manageable with proper state
   - Immutable updates are essential for predictable behavior

2. **Game Development**:
   - Physics simulations require careful state management
   - Chain reactions need robust detection algorithms
   - Visual feedback is crucial for user engagement

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - CSS transforms outperform other animation methods
   - Batching state updates prevents unnecessary renders
   - Animation locks prevent race conditions

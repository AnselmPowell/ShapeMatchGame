# Project Brief

## Shape Match Game

### Core Purpose
Shape Match is a physics-based puzzle game where players manipulate colored shape boxes on a grid. The objective is to clear all colored shapes by creating matches between identical adjacent shapes while strategically using gravity mechanics.

### Key Requirements

1. **Interactive Game Grid**
   - 8Ã—14 grid layout (configurable)
   - 6 distinct shape types with consistent colors
   - Horizontal-only movement system
   - Realistic gravity simulation with collision detection

2. **Core Gameplay Mechanics**
   - Player selects and moves shapes horizontally
   - Shapes fall due to gravity after movement
   - Adjacent identical shapes match and disappear
   - Chain reactions and cascades from falling shapes
   - Victory when all colored shapes are cleared

3. **Visual and Interactive Elements**
   - Smooth 60fps animations
   - Selection highlights and move indicators
   - Match effects and visual feedback
   - Modern UI with gradient backgrounds and particle effects
   - Responsive layout for desktop and mobile

4. **Technical Requirements**
   - Built with React 18+
   - Vite for fast development and building
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Modular component architecture
   - Custom hooks for separation of concerns
   - Pure utility functions for game logic

### Success Criteria
- Complete and fully functional game
- Smooth, bug-free gameplay
- Modern, visually appealing interface
- Code organization that follows React best practices
- Responsiveness across device sizes
- Maintainable and extensible codebase
